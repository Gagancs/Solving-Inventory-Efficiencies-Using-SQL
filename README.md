# 🛒 Solving Inventory Inefficiencies Using SQL

## 📊 Project Overview

**Urban Retail Co.** is a fast-growing mid-sized retail chain operating both physical stores and online platforms. With over 5,000 SKUs, we face major challenges in managing inventory effectively.

This project uses **SQL-driven analytics** to help the business:
- Detect stock inefficiencies
- Recommend reorder points
- Identify fast vs slow-moving items
- Optimize supply chain decisions using data
